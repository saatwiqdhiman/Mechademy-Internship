This repository contains the EDA for both the assignments in which Data analysis has been done alone with training the model and choosing the best model for the dataset.

Mechademy

This test contain two assignments.Both the assignments are quite simple, with the first assignment dealing with temperature forecasting, while the second assignment being a regression model.

                       Assignment 1 - Time Series Forecasting (using Weather_data.csv)
• Predict the temperature column ‘ _tempm’ for Delhi, using Time Series Forecasting
• Share your understanding of underlying data using descriptive analytics (You’re encouraged to
do data cleaning as well)
• For prediction, try multiple available techniques and choose the best performing model
• Does a time series model developed using deep learning techniques give more accurate
predictions?
• Model must take a date as input and output the probable temperature for that day (so basically
forecast to the given date and then report the value of that date)
• You are allowed to use the other accompanying features as input as well and create a multivariate forecasting model.
• The training data is available from Jan 1996 - Nov 2016. We will use data from Dec 2016 -
April 2017 to check the model accuracy/validity.

                                 Assignment 2 - Ailerons data set (using ailerons.csv)
This data set addresses a control problem, namely flying a F16 aircraft. The attributes describe the
status of the airplane, while the goal is to predict the control action on the ailerons of the aircraft.
• Proper EDA and Statistical analysis of data followed by Developing a model, to predict the
column “Goal”.
• Loss function is “RMSE”
• You are encouraged to try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative
results.
• Use of proper feature selection process and hyperparameter tuning (if required) is necessary.
• You’re allowed to do any feature engineering/feature selection you deem necessary
• Properly commenting the code is required
